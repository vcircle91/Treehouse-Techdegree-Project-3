# Interactive form
## Overview
This is my work for Treehouse project 3 where form validation, DOM manipulation and accessibility are topics.
## Fields to get validated in real-time
All mandatory fields are getting validated in real-time when user leaves the field.
## Field that has two different validations
Card number field shows some own message in case whitespaces are inserted besides the standard validation which checks for numbers only between 13 and 16 digits.
## Goal of this project
Besides practicing and learning my goal is to achieve "Exceeds expectation" grade.
